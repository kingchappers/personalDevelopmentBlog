<h1>
  Personal Development Blog
</h1>

This is just the repository for my personal development blog. I set it up to record some things I've learned and as a reference point for me when I forget how some tool or other works.

It runs on Gatsby with Bulma for styling. 

To run the site simply run the following commands:
  
  ```shell
  cd my-gatsby-site/
  npm run develop
  ```

The site runs on a static web app in Azure and is deployed directly from GitHub.
