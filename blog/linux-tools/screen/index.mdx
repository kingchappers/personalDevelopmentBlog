```
screen -S <sessionName>
```
Starts a new session with the specified name. The following are a list of keyboard shortcuts you can use while in a screen session.

* *CTRL+a c* - New window.
* *CTRL+a "* - List all windows.
* *CTRL+a 0* - Switch to window 0 or 0-9.
* *CTRL+a A* - Rename the current window.
* *CTRL+a S* - Split the current region into 2 horizontal areas.
* *CTRL+a |* - Split the current region into 2 vertical areas.
* *CTRL+a Tab* - Switch input focus to another region.

* *CTRL+a Q* - Close all regions but the current one.
