Hyena is a really good tool for enumerating an Active Directory network, as well as your own machine. It can show things such as:
* Drives
* Local Connections
* Users
* Local Groups
* Printers
* Shares
* Sessions
* Open Files
* Services
* Drivers
* Events Logs
* Disk Space
* User Rights
* Performance
* Scheduled Jobs
* Registry Information
* WMI Information

This can be shown for all devices under Active Directory management. This is a really useful tool for a system administrator as you can also edit settings on these devices and perform other administrative tasks. 

To perform a number of the functions Hyena allows you will need to have a fairly high level of privilege on the network already. This tool is far more suited to a system administrators needs; if you have the level of privilege required for this tool, as a penetration tester, you should have a good idea already of the network's structure. That being said it may still be a useful tool to cause a little mayhem once you're in the network.
